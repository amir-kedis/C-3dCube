# 3D cube rotating in space written in C with raylib

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project and other similar ones are made as a form of escapism from my final exams in college **Series now includes: Conway game of life, 3D cube**


### first try
https://github.com/amir-kedis/C-3dCube/assets/88613195/712bb6a3-8217-4692-8524-5a219ebec97e

- here I tried to control the object's rotation by changing the Carizian coordinates which didn't give me the results I wanted for rotation.



### second try
https://github.com/amir-kedis/C-3dCube/assets/88613195/2a312801-45dc-4a2f-bb76-9bb8c01c8f2c

- after that, I made a coordinate transformation using spherical coordination, which worked better.

## Controls

- `D` and `A` -> change  theta -> rotate around the y-axis (left-right)
- `W` and `S` -> change  phi   -> rotate around the x-axis (up-down)
- `Q` and `E` -> change  r     -> change the magnitude (zoom)
